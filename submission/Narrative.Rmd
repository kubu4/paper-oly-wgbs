# Methods
_Outplanting_
Adult olympia oyster originally from Fidalgo Bay, in North Puget Sound were grown out at two locations including Fidalgo Bay and Oyster Bay (located in South Puget Sound).

_Draft Genome Assembly_
A draft genome for the Olympia oyster was created using a combination of short read sequence data ( ) combined with long read sequence data using PBJelly (reference). 

Sequence reads from the 5 mate paire libaries (list these out) were assembled using Soap Denov (ref). The scaffold (number) from this assembling were combined with a XXX of long read sequence data produced on xxxxx using PBJelly.
