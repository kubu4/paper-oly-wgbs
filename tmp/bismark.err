Bowtie seems to be working fine (tested command '/Applications/bioinfo/bowtie2-2.3.4.1-macos-x86_64/bowtie2 --version' [2.3.4])
Output format is BAM (default)
Did not find Samtools on the system. Alignments will be compressed with GZIP instead (.sam.gz)
Reference genome folder provided is ../tmp/	(absolute path is '/Users/sr320/Documents/GitHub/paper-oly-wgbs/tmp/)'
Processing sequences up to read no. 1000 from the input file
